The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.Produced on a budget of ₹25 crore (US$5.3 million), Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur (1957) in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.Lagaan was theatrically released in India on 15 June 2001, clashing with Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. It received critical acclaim for Gowariker's direction, Khan's performance and the film's anti-imperialist stance. With earnings of ₹65.97 crore (US$13.98 million) during its initial release, the film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001. Lagaan was screened at numerous international film festivals and garnered multiple accolades. It was the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988). Lagaan became the most-awarded film at the 47th Filmfare Awards with eight wins, including Best Film, Best Director for Gowariker and Best Actor for Khan.

He is approached by Safina Kidwai, a 14-year-old girl married to the majority share owner of the star hotel, Freddie Rehman, to help her escape to India. Upon his refusal, she steals his phone and discreetly records a meeting in Shaan's phone between Shailendra 'Shelly' Rungta and her husband, about buying and smuggling illegal arms into Bangladesh. She also takes pictures of the paperwork and returns the phone to Shaan, so that he can view everything. Upon seeing everything, he goes to his friend, Vikram Bhagwat, of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, to share the information and evidence.Vikram, in-turn, sends the information to RAW officer, Lipika Saikia Rao, who is the in-charge of Bangladesh, in New Delhi. She has been keeping tabs on Shelly and believes that the evidence she received from Safina and Shaan is enough to officially go after him. She requests Shaan to keep Safina safe for a night, till she arrives in Dhaka the next afternoon. Meanwhile, both Freddie and Shelly come to know about their meeting being leaked; Shelly asks Freddie to kill Safina. He, along with his men, searches the entire hotel for her. Shaan takes Safina to a new wing that is currently under construction in the star hotel, for safekeeping. The next day, as he goes out to get food for Safina, he calls Lipika to inquire about her current whereabouts; Lipika realises that her phone has been bugged and orders Shaan to hurry back to Safina. He comes back just as Safina falls to her death from the wing. Her death is ruled as a suicide by the local police, who say that she stole jewellery from the high-profile guests in the hotel and jumped as she was caught. This devastates both Shaan and Lipika, knowing completely well that both Freddie and Shelly were behind her death. This prompts Shaan to leave his job.Two years later, Shaan now lives as a recluse in Shimla, working as a night manager in a star resort. He is constantly haunted by his failure to protect Safina. One day, his superior tells him that Shelly, along with his associates, is coming to stay in the hotel for a few days. Once they arrive, Shaan collects information from the trash in his room and mails it to Lipika. Over the course of his stay, Shelly constantly runs into Shaan. Each time, he is impressed with Shaan's demeanour. He even gives his coat to Shaan, as a token of remembrance, as he leaves the resort. The next day, Shaan is visited by an undercover Lipika, who has now been demoted to the archives section of the agency. They both decide to infiltrate Shelly's syndicate. After a dramatic set-up orchestrated by Lipika and her co-worker, Sarang, Shaan is able to reach Sri Lanka, by posing as an international runaway, to get close to Shelly.He saves his son, Taha, in a fake kidnapping planned by Lipika. However, to further make it look real, he purposefully gets injured. Upon seeing and searching Shaan, both Shelly and his right-hand man, Brij Pal alias BJ, find a Sri Lankan passport with a different alias, on him.

advanced chatbot ChatGPT.The Italian data-protection authority said there were privacy concerns relating to the model, which was created by US start-up OpenAI and is backed by Microsoft.The regulator said it would ban and investigate OpenAI with immediate effect.OpenAI told the BBC it complied with privacy laws.Millions of people have used ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022.It can answer questions using natural, human like language and it can also mimic other writing styles, using the internet as it was in 2021 as its database.Microsoft has spent billions of dollars on it and it was added to Bing last month.It has also said that it will embed a version of the technology in its Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.There have been concerns over the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI), including its threat to jobs and the spreading of misinformation and bias.Earlier this week key figures in tech, including Elon Musk, called for these types of AI systems to be suspended amid fears the race to develop them was out of control.The Italian watchdog said that not only would it block OpenAI's chatbot but it would also investigate whether it complied with General Data Protection Regulation.GDPR governs the way in which we can use, process and store personal data.The watchdog said on 20 March that the app had experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.It said there was no legal basis to justify the mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of training the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform.It also said that since there was no way to verify the age of users, the app exposes minors to absolutely unsuitable answers compared to their degree of development and awareness.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya

It's unreadable, he added.There has been no official comment from Twitter and the New York Times has not responded to Mr Musk's comments.Under Twitter's new rules, blue ticks which once showed official, verified accounts, will start to be removed from accounts which do not pay for it.Organisations seeking verification badges instead have to pay a monthly fee of $1,000 (£810) to receive a gold verification tick, while individual accounts must pay $8 (£6.40) a month for a blue one.The subscription service will generate revenue for Twitter. However, concerns have been raised that without the verification process, it will be difficult to tell genuine accounts from impersonators.As well as not paying the subscription fee, the New York Times said it would also not pay for the verification of its journalists' Twitter accounts, apart from in rare instances where this status would be essential for reporting purposes, a spokesperson said.Following the announcement, the newspaper, which has almost 55 million Twitter followers, lost its verification badge.But it is unclear whether all organisations must sign up to the subscription service in order to remain verified.Ten thousand of the most-followed organisations on Twitter will be exempt from the rules, the New York Times reports, citing an internal Twitter document.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Many people I know considered the Nord CE Lite as it was a OnePlus device. Cut to the chase; the company has now launched the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite with the same Snapdragon 695 SoC.I have been playing around with the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite for the last two weeks, and here is my take on what could probably be the most affordable 5G smartphone from OnePlus in 2023.After unboxing the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, I couldnt help but marvel at the pastel lime colour of the device, which also has some neon green accents. The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite does look a lot like the Realme 10 Pro. However, the subtle OnePlus branding at the back does make all the difference.The Nord CE 3 Lite being a budget offering, has the basics covered, including a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD card slot, although not a dedicated one. While it lacks the iconic alert slider, its quite understandable how OnePlus is pitching the alert slider as more of a premium feature.The Nord CE 3 Lite is also available in black colour, but that just looks blunt, at least in my opinion. It has a plastic back panel like its predecessor. While it does attract smudges and fingerprints, they arent very evident, at least on the lemon green variant. Overall, when compared to its predecessor, the Data Nord CE 3 Lite looks and feels a lot more premium.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

US-based AI powerhouse OpenAI is currently leading the race when it comes to deploying generative AI. And, this has prompted many technology companies around the world to research and develop AI solutions to break the monopoly.At a recent interaction at the Zoho Path event, Sridhar Vembu, the co-founder and the CEO of Zoho said that his team has been testing various indigenous and open-sourced AI solutions. He asserted that he is optimistic about AI technology. Vembu also expressed his concerns over monopoly in AI technology adding that collaborative efforts need to be directed towards building capable AI solutions in India that could be as good as or even better than GPT-4. And, all this with the support of the government.Vembu, Rajiv Kumar (Chairman, Pahle India Foundation), and Sharad Sharma (co-founder of iSPIRT Foundation) have signed on an open letter to the Government of India requesting it initiate an effort to catch up with the AI developments and prevent any kind of monopoly in AI in India. Vembu recommended setting up an AI public policy with the objective of preventing any kind of monopoly in AI and fostering development of indigenous AI technology.He also said, “there should be a strong regulatory framework around AI with openness and transparency.” Vembu said, “The first set of jobs that AI could put a threat to is programming job.” He is also optimistic about low-code no-code platforms, where one developer can replace 100 developers with the help of AI.The Princeton University alumnus also cited the recent instance where leading AI scientist Yoshua Bengio, entrepreneur Elon Musk, and other tech pioneers signed open letter seeking to momentarily halt the advancements in AI considering its imminent threat to society.Vembu also said that AI could be like a power loop, where it could automate a lot of things.

The inventor conceptualised a cell phone that wouldnt be chained to the car. Rather, it would be portable. The result? The DynaTAC (Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) phone, which was 23 cm tall and weighed 1.1 kg.Now, 50 years later, the inventor says hes “devastated” when he sees people staring at their phones while crossing the street. “They are out of their minds,” he added in an interview with the AFP News Agency.How Martin Cooper invented the cellphone : When AT&T proposed a cellular architecture to expand its car-phone service, Motorola feared that the telecom company would grow into a monopoly. Martin Cooper was placed in charge of the urgent project to develop a cellphone. The result was DynaTAC (Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage), which allowed 35 minutes of talk time before it ran out of battery.Cooper showed off the first cellphone to AT&T rival : On April 3, 1973, Cooper introduced the DynaTAC phone at a press conference in New York. To make sure that the phone was working before the start of the event, he rang engineer Joel Engel, head of AT&Ts rival project, announcing he was calling from a portable cellphone.The first commercial cellphone was a success despite the steep price tagAfter years of development, Motorola in 1983 introduced the first portable cellphone for consumers, the DynaTAC 8000x. Despite the steep price tag of $3,995, the phone was a success.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

The lens has XD linear motors and control algorithms that optimise responses to the control signals so that focus is more precise, vibrations are minimised and autofocus operates more quietly. This should make the lens appropriate for shooting videos.The lens has an 11-blade circular aperture which offers “sharp realism” throughout the maximum aperture range, according to the company. When shooting wide open at F1.4, the lens should be able to offer creamy bokeh and great depth of field that can separate subjects clearly from the background.The FE 50mm F1.4 GM lens comes with two extreme aspherical elements that are aimed at effectively correcting field curvature and aberrations.

When the time came, I was left disappointed as I wasnt able to verify my name on my boarding pass using Aadhaar.This time around, I was running a bit late for airport and I wanted to give DigiYatra another try just to ensure I clear the security as quickly as possible. I was in a luck this time around as the booking had my correct name — Vivek U, thanks IndiGo for understanding people can also have single digit sur name.Some flight carriers want users have have a full second name with at least two characters (surname) while I just have a single initial on Aadhaar although I have a longer surname on my passport.Setting up the DigiYatra app Setting up the DigiYatra app is fairly simple. I downloaded the app from the Google Play Store and logged in using my phone number and quickly likned my Aadhaar, again using the OTP verification method. The app is also available for iPhones.Next I uploaded the flight ticket (pdf) for the DigiYatra to fetch all the details about the flight. Lastly, I had to take a selfie to authenticate and then allow the app to share my data with the airport, in this case its the kempegowda internernational airport.My experience of using DigiYatra At the initial security checkpoint, all I have to do is show my face to the digital kiosk and scan the barcode on the DigiYatra app. My face will then be verified with the one I shared earlier on the app along with my details via the Aadhaar that I have linked to the DigiYatra app.Once I got in, during the primary scanning area, I again posed at the digital kiosk and I was let in and all this took less than three minutes. The next 13 minutes were spend at putting by luggage through the xray scanner.Why I liked about the DigiYatra app It cuts down the time spent at security checks. I was able to cut the regular cue and then there is no need to carry any additional documents, where, your face works as the authenticator. I was able to complete my two-level security checks in just 15 minutes, which is the least time that it has ever taken to clear security at the Bengaluru airport.While there are no actual cons of using DigiYatra instead of conventional security process at the airport, I do have a few suggestions to make.

Owing to a music streaming boom in the country, theres now a slew of music streaming services to pick from. And the days of having to painstakingly download every song from shady MP3 sites are long past. But with so many options to pick from, its difficult to stay loyal to a single service sometimes.If youve ever switched music services, then you must be familiar with the struggle of transferring each song and re-curating playlists. Helping ease that process is the nifty tool Soundiiz, which not only helps transfer entire playlists between music streaming apps but also helps keep them in sync. See how you can use the tool below.Getting started 1. Visit soundiiz.com on any device and log in using the button on the top right 2. Youll be directed straight to the Soundiiz web app 3. Tap the hamburger menu icon on the top left and hit the Connect Services button on the bottom left 4. Here, hit the Connect button for the services you wish to transfer/sync playlists between 1. Open the hamburger menu again and tap on Transfer under the Tools section 2. Select source (the service you wish to transfer your playlists from) and destination (the service you wish to transfer to) 3. Hit the Start button 4. Hit the pencil icon to select the playlist you wish to transfer. Note that youll only be able to transfer one playlist at a time if you are a free Soundiiz user 5. Keep hitting the Confirm buttons at the bottom to proceed until you see the Transferring screenWhile youll not be able to transfer more than one playlist at a time, you can always repeat the process until youve transferred all your playlists.Sync playlists If you keep juggling between two or more music streaming platforms, like Spotify and Apple Music for example, then keeping your playlists in sync between the two can be a tedious task. Soundiiz automates this process – when youve turned on sync between two playlists, adding a new track for one playlist will automatically insert the same track into another.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Last year saw the release of the Steam Deck – a device built for PC gaming in a smartphone-like form factor – and a full year since it began shipping, the handheld sits fourth in Steams top sellers list.On April 1, Asus too unveiled a portable gaming device of its own to take on the Steam Deck. Its a fast-populating market, and we, therefore, decided to bunch up the best gaming handhelds into a single listicle so that you dont have to go looking around.Asus has announced its first gaming handheld, the ROG Ally, which promises to deliver a powerful PC gaming experience on a 7-inch 1100p 120Hz display. The device runs Windows 11 and uses a custom AMD Ryzen chip that can be paired with an external GPU for more performance. The ROG Ally was initially teased on April 1st, but Asus confirmed that it was not an April Fools joke and that it will be available soon.The ROG Ally will compete with Valves Steam Deck, which has a similar design but a lower-resolution 60Hz screen and runs a Linux-based OS. Asus claims that the ROG Ally can run any game that its hardware can handle, unlike the Steam Deck which is limited to some games in the Steam library.The Nintendo Switch is perhaps the most popular device in its category, with sales surpassing the Game Boy and PS last month. It also stands out from this list because it runs on its own software codenamed Horizon instead of using a spin of Windows. The Switch name pertains to the fact that the console can be used in three ways: handheld, tabletop and TV. In tabletop and TV modes, the controls detach from the screen.Available unofficially on Amazon for a starting price of Rs 52,800 (since the device is yet to launch officially in the country), Valves Steam Deck can be thought of as a portable gaming laptop allowing you to play your existing Steam library on the go. It has a 7-inch touchscreen, full-size controls, and a custom AMD processor that can run AAA games smoothly…including Cyberpunk 2077.The Steam Deck also supports a docked mode that connects to a monitor for a bigger screen. It runs on SteamOS, a Linux-based system that can run Windows games through Valves Proton compatibility layer.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Or you could be working at a cafe trying to mind your own business but are bothered by an invasive seatmate.Helping with these problems is a browser extension for WhatsApp Web that blurs out contact names, their profile pictures, and/or their messages on the chat list. Called WA Web Plus, the extension extends the chat apps feature list and enhances privacy. Heres how you can use it.While WA Web Pluss website claims that the extension is built for Chrome, it should also work on Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and Brave, since they use the same engine (Chromium). We tested it out on Edge and it worked expectedly. However, browsers like Firefox and Safari are left out since they cannot install from the Chrome Web Store.The WA Web Pluss list of features is overwhelmingly lengthy but some features are obviously more useful than others: Blur recent messages, contact names, contact photos, and conversation messages: Your colleagues will only see what you want them to see when youve toggled these on.Set lock screen password: If you are in the habit of your leaving your PC open when you go on lunch breaks then its important to ensure that no one has access to your WhatsApp but you even when youre away.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

In terms of hardware, the Apple Reality Pro could easily be the most powerful consumer-grade virtual-reality headset, which is said to run on a custom rOS, powered by a custom Apple Silicon.The device is said to weigh between 300 to 400 grams, and is likely to pack two high-resolution OLED eyepieces, possibly with 4K resolution per eye along with a plethora of sensors for eye and head tracking. This is said to be a standalone device.

Five years later, prosecutors say he tried to squelch an investigation into that same financer under former President Donald Trumps administration.At the heart of the case is Low Taek Jho, usually known as Jho Low. He is accused of masterminding an international money laundering and bribery scheme that stole billions from the Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB.DiCaprios connection with the case comes from his years-long relationship with Low, who was one of the primary financers of the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Low is currently a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.According to the charges, Michel essentially became a conduit for Lows pilfered millions and his attempts to influence the U.S. government. Prosecutors allege that from June to November 2012, Low directed more than $21.6 million to be moved from foreign entities to Michels accounts in order to funnel money into the 2012 presidential election. They say Michel then paid about 20 straw donors and conduits so they could make the donations in their names and conceal where the money actually came from, according to the indictment.DiCaprio testified that he met and befriended Low at a birthday party in Las Vegas in 2010. “I understood him to be a huge businessman with many different connections in Abu Dhabi and Malaysia,” he said.The 48-year-old Oscar winner answered questions on the witness stand calmly — occasionally deferring to a fuzzy memory on some details and dates. In addition to his relationship with Low, DiCaprio said he had known the defendant Michel since sometime in the 1990s when they met backstage after a Fugees concert.Low was known for hosting lavish star-studded parties and group vacations on his private jet to events like the World Cup in Brazil. DiCaprio recounted one particular junket that involved flying to Australia to celebrate New Years Eve, then flying to Las Vegas to celebrate a second time in one day. Michel was present on some of these trips, DiCaprio said.Low became a regular contributor to DiCaprios charitable foundation, and eventually Low floated the idea of providing the primary financing for “The Wolf of Wall Street.”DiCaprio said he had Lows funding and legitimacy carefully vetted before entering into a business relationship.“I was given the green light by my team as well as my studio,” he said. “He was a legitimate business person wanting to invest in the movie.”DiCaprio also recalled a “casual conversation” with Low in which Low told him he intended to make a large contribution to Obamas reelection campaign.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Since first launching in 2014 with John Wick ($14 million on its opening weekend), the Chad Stahelski-directed series has steadily grown as a ticket-seller with each sequel. The 2017 follow-up opened with $30.4 million, and the 2019 third chapter, Parabellum, debuted with $56.8 million.But Chapter 4, running two hours and 49 minutes and costing at least $100 million to produce, is the biggest film yet in the once-lean action series. Critics also said it was a franchise high point, scoring 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, which drew a 69% male audience, added $64 million overseas. Its Lionsgates biggest success of the pandemic era.“When you make a fourth in an action franchise, you have to expect it to go down. That is the nature of these franchises,” said Joe Drake, chairman of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “But we kept seeing signals and it was wonderful to see the movie they delivered. We saw the audience wanting more.”Though John Wick has been bigger at the box office with each new release — an enviable and rare trajectory among Hollywood franchises — Chapter 4 brings some finality to Reeves character. The actor hasnt entirely dismissed continuing the series, telling interviewers “never say never.”Regardless, the franchise is set to keep humming. A spin-off titled Ballerina starring Ana de Armas and co-starring Reeves has already been shot. The miniseries The Continental, with Mel Gibson, is upcoming on Peacock.“Chad and Keanu have created this world and that world continues to expand. I dont know what all the edges of that world are, still,” said Drake. “As best they can, theyll continue to try to seduce Keanu to come back and do things. He gets beat up in these shows. He really does. And at the end hes like, Im not doing it anymore. Then you watch him sit in the theater and feel that audience.”“So were going to continue to look for ways to meet that demand.”The release of John Wick: Chapter 4, which included a surprise premiere at SXSW, was also bittersweet. Lance Reddick, who plays the Continental Hotel concierge, Charon, in the films, unexpectedly died at the age of 60 a week before the films release.But the success of John Wick: Chapter 4 adds to a strong start in 2023 for Hollywood. After ticket sales rebounded to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels last year, the release lineup is steadier and more packed this year. Sequels have led the way, including Creed III and Scream VI.

Heres a look at the nominations and the wins.",DataDetailDescription:"The 95th Academy Award might turn out to be a prosperous one for the Indian filmmaking fraternity with three nominations this year. After winning a Golden Globe, the infectious Naatu Naatu, from SS Rajamoulis epic action drama film RRR (2022), might just clench the Best Original Song at the Oscars tomorrow. Moreover, All That Breathes (2022) by Shaunak Sen and Aman Mann is in the running for Best Documentary Feature while Kartiki Gonsalves and Guneet Mongas Elephant Whisperers (2022) has been nominated for Best Documentary (Short Subject).So far, 13 Indians have been nominated to the Oscars and eight of them have won the prestigious award. Heres a look at all the nominations for Indian films, documentaries and shorts for the Academy.1958: Though not an official entry, Mehboob Khans Mother India (1957) was the first Indian film to receive an honorary mention in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 30th Academy Awards. It was a critical and commercial success, both in India and abroad and was also nominated for the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival. The film is a powerful portrayal of the resilience and strength of Indian women, with Nargis delivering a remarkable performance in the lead role.1961: At the 33rd Oscars, producer Ismail Merchants 13-minute short film The Creation of Woman (1961) and directed by Charles F Schwep was nominated in the Best Short Subject (Live Action) category. It, however, didnt win. The film, narrated by Saeed Jaffrey, portrays the genesis of man and woman from the perspective of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. The lead roles are performed by two skilled dancers, while Bhaskar Roy Chowdhury portrays the character of God.1969: Fali Bilimorias short documentary The House That Ananda Built (1968) was nominated for Best Documentary (Short Subject) at the 41st Academy Awards but it didnt win. The documentary follows Ananda, a successful businessman in Nagpur, and looks at his life, children and beliefs from prior to independence until 20 years after.1978: Ishu Patels short animated Bead Game (1977) was nominated in the Best Animated Short Film category at the 50th Academy Awards, though it did not win. The film features a series of intricate hand-drawn animations, set to a haunting soundtrack of Indian classical music. The images depict the life cycle of a single organism, from birth to death and rebirth, as well as the larger cycles of nature and the cosmos.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Here are four.",DataDetailDescription:"In a rush to put every last egg in the RRR basket, the films legions of admirers failed to realise one important thing about Oscar campaigns: fans dont get to pick the winners. When it was decided, for whatever reason, that the largely unseen Chhello Show would represent India at the Academy Awards, the RRR brigade was up in arms. While the Indian contingent was typically toxic in its social media dissent, the Americans whod been desperately trying to emulate desi behaviour (including our willing ignorance of socio-political context), decided that they, too, must voice their dissatisfaction. Nobody was quite sure about whom to direct their anger at, which resulted in vague fist-waving on Twitter.But sheer popularity — or, in the case of RRR, cult success — isnt enough to guarantee a nomination. As has been repeated ad nauseam by this point, Academy Awards campaigns are highly political. And at the end of the day, a film has to actually be good to score a nomination, regardless of how much money is funneled into getting people to watch it. Which is why the travelling circus that everybody put their money on didnt ultimately score more than one nod, and the darling festival hit documentary All that Breathes actually did exactly what was expected of it. Without a rabid social media campaign.Although fans of RRR would understandably disagree, Chhello Show wasnt a particularly bad pick for the Best International Feature category. In fact, theres proof to support this argument; did you know that its the only Indian movie to progress to the shortlist stage of voting since the Academy began announcing these shortlists in 2006? Chhello Show had a real shot at securing a nod. There was a sound strategy at play here; had things gone as planned, India wouldve had three feature films in contention in three different categories. Not to mention The Elephant Whisperers, which is competing in the Best Documentary Short category.Theres no way of knowing if the Film Federation of India shot itself in the foot by not selecting RRR. But what we do know is that members of the Academy respond to certain ingredients in their foreign language films, once enough money has been spent on attracting their attention, of course. On paper, RRR and Chhello Show had all the components — they were culturally specific, yet thematically accessible — but here are four other options that might have had a shot at Oscars success, provided, of course, that theyd been bestowed with all the bells and whistles of an Academy Awards campaign.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Sundays Academy Awards wont give a prize for best villain, but if they did, Miles Bron would win it in a walk. (With apologies to the cloud of Nope.) He is an immediately recognisable type weve grown well acquainted with: a visionary (or so everyone says), a social media narcissist, a self-styled disrupter who talks a lot about “breaking stuff”.Miles Bron is just the Data in a long line of Hollywoods favorite villain: the tech bro. Looking north to Silicon Valley, the movie industry has found perhaps its richest resource of big-screen antagonists since Soviet-era Russia.Great movie villains dont come along often. The best-picture nominated Top Gun: Maverick, like its predecessor, was content to battle with a faceless enemy of unspecified nationality. Why antagonise international ticket buyers when Tom Cruise vs. Whomever works just fine but in recent years, the tech bro has proliferated on movie screens as Hollywoods go-to bad guy. Its a rise that has mirrored mounting fears over technologys expanding reach into our lives and increasing skepticism for the not always altruistic motives of the men – and it is mostly men – who control todays digital empires.Weve had the devious Biosyn Genetics CEO (Campbell Scott) in Jurassic World: Dominion, a franchise dedicated to the peril of tech overreach; Chris Hemsworths biotech overlord in Spiderhead; and Mark Rylances maybe-Earth-destroying tech guru in 2021′s Dont Look Up. Weve had Eisenberg, again, as a tech bro-styled Lex Luthor in 2016′s Batman v. Superman; Harry Mellings pharmaceutical entrepreneur in 2020s The Old Guard; Taika Waititis rule-breaking videogame mogul in 2021′s Free Guy; Oscar Isaacs search engine CEO in 2014′s Ex Machina; and the critical portrait of the Apple co-founder in 2015′s Steve Jobs.Kids movies, too, regularly channel parental anxieties about technologys impact on children. In 2021′s The Mitchells vs. the Machines, a newly launched AI brings about a robot apocalypse. Rons Gone Wrong (2021) also used a robot metaphor for smartphone addiction. And TV series have just as aggressively rushed to dramatize Big Tech blunders. Recent entries include: Ubers Travis Kalanick in Showtimes Super Pumped; Theranos Elizabeth Holmes in Hulus The Dropout; and WeWorks Adam and Rebekah Neumann in Apple TVs We Crashed. Some of these portrayals you could chalk up to Hollywood jealousy over the emergence of another California epicenter of innovation. But those worlds merged long ago. Many of the companies that released these movies are disrupters, themselves — none more than Netflix, distributor of Glass Onion. The streamer was cajoled into releasing Johnsons sequel more widely in theaters than any previous Netflix release. Estimates suggested the film collected some $15 million over opening weekend, the old fashioned way, but Netflix executives have said they dont plan to make a habit of such theatrical rollouts.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

As such, exercising regularly gives a boost to your self-esteem and makes you feel better. However, many of us do not find the time or motivation to exercise daily. But the good news is that, as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity activity is enough to keep you healthy and fit. That comes around to approximately 10 to 11 minutes per day, not too bad, right?For this, we have got the perfect workout routine that you can do anywhere at any time. Here is the 10-minute workout routine by celebrity fitness instructor, Yasmin Karachiwala, to make you glow from the inside out.A plank pose, or Kumbhakasana, is one of the foundational poses in yoga. A high plank roll is a variation to the traditional plank pose. Singh said, “It provides stability and strength to the core muscles, which contain your oblique, lower back, and all of the side muscles. This exercise will also help enhance your twisting stability.To perform this move, go down on your fours. Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders with your back and legs aligned in a straight line. Contract your abs and rotate and pivot towards the right. Press your hands while knocking your feet on the other side. Repeat this with the other leg as well.“Reverse lunges are an excellent way to work your hamstrings, glutes, calves and quads, while providing you with lower body strength,” said Singh. It is a great option for beginners as it is easy to control the backward motion.First, stand shoulder-width apart. Then, inhale and carefully take a big step backwards with your right foot as you bend both knees to 90 degrees, making sure your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. Now, exhale and extend both knees while transferring your weight onto your left foot. At the same time, raise your right foot to bring your knee near your chest. Lower your right leg to the starting position. Repeat this on the other side.Squats are one of the main movement patterns humans use in their daily life– we perform it every time we sit down and get up from a chair.  Singh said this movement helps strengthen lateral muscles. He added that it is beneficial for people who play sports like football and lawn tennis. “The side-to-side squats activate several muscle groups simultaneously, working the legs, glutes, and core. The squat increases performance and flexibility and the side-to-side movement improves dynamic balance and agility,” he added.To do this exercise, start with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands in front holding each other. Then, start to hinge at the hips and bend your knees slightly. Ensure that your back is straight up. Now, push your leg to one side and bend your other knee. Bring the leg back so that both of them are together. Then, repeat the process to the other side.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Fitness instructor and Pilates expert Namrata Purohit shared a video on her Instagram page that delves into what causes back pain, from the point of view of the body, and shared four tips that can help reduce or even get rid of the pain. “Back Pain, No Pain! Here are 4 tips to help reduce or get rid of lower back pain!,” she captioned the post.The first thing she attributes lower back pain to is our posture. It is no mystery that having a bad posture can harm our spine, and in turn cause pain. Namrata says the way to fix it is by doing isometric strength training. Simply put by doing planks. “Planks are a highly effective exercise activating the muscles for spinal stabilisation. So get strong!” A 2021 study by Gautam Gupta and Mayank Alok, published in the International Journal of Science and Research, found that “Plank training is useful in enhancing the quality of life and reducing pain in low back pain.”The next tip from Namarta is to strengthen the abs and our core. “The most important thing is to work the core. Working the abs and the core helps maintain proper spinal curvature and a neutral pelvic tilt which is important for preventing back pain. It also lifts the pressure of your spine,” the expert shares.Stiff hips are the third reason your lower back may be hurting. “Stiff hips can lead to lower back pain,” Namrata claims, adding, “A lack of rotational mobility and the ability to flex or extend your hips forward or backwards, can affect your walking and running. Every motion will increase the mechanical strain on your lower back.” To open your hips, exercises such as the reclined pigeon pose or extended child’s pose are ideal.The last tip is to build our glute muscles. “The glute muscles are the main stabilisers of the pelvis and help support the lower back. When these muscles are weak, you overcompensate by using the muscle in your back to stabalise the body. This adds stress and tension to the lower back,” she says. Bridge pose is an excellent pose to strengthen these muscles.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

The benefits of exercise far outweigh the temporary feeling of muscle soreness that can accompany a new exercise regime",DataDetailDescription:"Getting in the habit of exercising isn’t easy. Not only is finding the time to exercise a major deterrent for people, the fear of aches, pain and injuries is also a reason that people put off starting a new exercise regime.But exercise doesn’t necessarily have to lead to pain or injuries. Here are some simple things you can do to avoid these when starting out.It’s important to warm up before your exercise. Warming up raises the temperature of the working muscles and the whole body. It also prepares your body for the increased stress of exercise. Muscles that have been warmed up are able to exercise for longer, and suffer less soreness and reduced injury risk.Exactly what constitutes an effective warm-up varies from workout to workout. But in general, you should dedicate at least five to ten minutes of your workout to warming up. Start with large, whole-body movements such as body-weight squats and lunges before progressing to more task-specific actions – such as a walk or jog before running, or lifting light weights before weight training. Your warm-up shouldn’t be too strenuous. Aim to use only about 40-60% of your maximum effort.A common mistake when starting a new exercise regime is to do too much. This can lead to pain after workouts, and may also increase your likelihood of injury.When you first begin a new workout plan, it’s important to start gradually and at your own pace. Since everyone is different, avoid following an exercise programme that uses absolute distances or repetitions. Instead, focus on how you feel during a workout and listen to what your body is telling youIt can take weeks or even months to notice the benefits of exercise, so don’t expect to see your health and fitness improve overnight. It’s also worth noting that progress isn’t always linear – some days you may find it’s difficult to exercise as long or as hard as you did the previous session. Listen to your body and stop when you feel tired, to avoid injury.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

As such, Aditi Zawar, a yoga instructor, who often shares videos on wellness, took to Instagram to share a yoga asana that she said can help prevent us from falling sick owing to the weather changes. “It is getting extremely cold out there. If you are someone who is prone to infections like cold, cough, or other flu-related to the colder seasons, here is one prayanam that can help you warm your body,” she said in the video.Stressing “breath is medicine”, she demonstrated ‘suryabhedi pranayama‘, a breathing technique that requires the practitioner to inhale from the right nostril while holding the other one with a finger and then exhaling through the left nostril. This, she suggested, can be done 8 to 10 times a day.Explaining its benefits she said, “The suryabhedi pranayama activates the sun element in our body and keeps it warm. . It helps improve your ability to fight flus and infections like cold, sinusitis, bronchitis, Covid, and other respiratory problems. It also purifies the blood and helps relieve symptoms of indigestion.”Agreeing, yoga trainer Ira Trivedi said that as the pranayama — which focuses only on the right nostril (also known as surya nadi or Pingala) — activates the Surya nadi, which helps kickstart one’s metabolism. “Since the practice aggravates the pitta dosha, it stimulates the digestive fire and aids proper digestion.

But among such, many a time, helpful information there creep in some that are simply false or widely-believed myths. As such, to help you make informed choices on your weight loss journey, Simrun Chopra, a nutritionist and coach, took to Instagram to debunk certain common myths.I know the feeling of not wanting to go on a diet. Or of eating whatever you can on Sunday night before you start Monday,” she captioned an Instagram video, adding that the diet culture in India has been made “worse because of menu plans and not a diet plan.A diet has calories and macro splits, etc. It doesn’t have menus. It shouldn’t tell you what to eat and when, as it is unsustainable. The only way to lose weight is when you consume fewer calories than you burn, calorie deficitIt is commonly believed that you cannot have tea or coffee if you are trying to lose weight. However, Simrun said all one needs to do is strike a balance rather than giving up on the beverages. “Just accommodate calories. Reduce it to half milk-half water and ½ to 1 tsp sugar,” she suggested, adding that tea and coffee should not be consumed more than twice a day.Again, you do not need to stop eating out. Instead, check the menu and look for things that fit your macros in general, and avoid very oily, deep fried food. “Share the dessert and don’t overeat. Remember, you’re eating for taste here. Eat slowly and enjoy the flavours,” she added.Again, this is a myth. Simrun stressed that no food can increase metabolic rate. According to the expert, one must focus on increasing muscle mass to increase the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). “These are the muscles that hold our skeleton together and help with basic stuff like lifting things or standing and walking. It doesn’t mean you’ll become a bodybuilder overnight,” she explained.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Personal finances and current and political events were major sources of stress for one-third or more of adults, a survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found in October.Stress isn’t inherently bad, said Richard Scrivener, a personal trainer and product development manager at London’s Trainfitness, an education technology company. Stressing your muscles through weight training, for example, leads to beneficial changes. In addition, short-term stress in healthy people typically isn’t a hazard. “But if stress is continuous, especially in older or unhealthy individuals, the long-term effects of the response to stress may lead to significant health issues,” Scrivener said.Stress occurs when you face a new, unpredictable or threatening situation, and you don’t know whether you can manage it successfully, said clinical psychologist Dr. Karmel Choi, an assistant professor in the Center for Precision Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Luckily, there are many ways to combat stress. Keep a daily routine, get plenty of sleep, eat healthy foods, and limit your time following the news or engaging in social media, recommends the World Health Organization. It also helps to stay connected with others and to employ calming practices such as meditation and deep breathing. One of the most successful tools, though, is physical activity.Exercise is remarkably effective for managing psychological stress,” Choi said. “Exercise doesn’t remove what’s causing the stress, but it can boost mood, reduce tension and improve sleep — all of which are impacted by stress — and ultimately this can support people to approach their challenges in a more balanced way.Numerous studies back up the positive effect of exercise on stress. Physical activity, and especially exercise, significantly reduced the symptoms of anxiety in a study published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, for example. Similarly, a Frontiers in Psychology study of university students found that regularly engaging in low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for six weeks helped alleviate their depressive symptoms and perceived stress.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Makes you stronger Strength training helps you become stronger.Gaining strength allows you to perform daily tasks much easier, such as carrying heavy groceries or running around with your kids (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).Furthermore, it helps improve athletic performance in sports that require speed, power, and strength, and it may even support endurance athletes by preserving lean muscle mass (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).2. Burns calories efficiently Strength training helps boost your metabolism in two ways.First, building muscle increases your metabolic rate. Muscles are more metabolically efficient than fat mass, allowing you to burn more calories at rest (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).Second, research shows that your metabolic rate is increased up to 72 hours after strength-training exercise. This means that youre still burning additional calories hours and even days after your workout (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).3. Decreases abdominal fat .Fat stored around the abdomen, especially visceral fat, is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).Multiple studies have shown the benefit of strength-training exercises for reducing abdominal and total body fat (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).4. Can help you appear leaner As you build more muscle and lose fat, you will appear leaner.This is because muscle is more dense than fat, meaning it takes up less space on your body pound for pound. Therefore, you may lose inches off of your waist even if you dont see a change in the number on the scale.Also, losing body fat and building stronger and larger muscles showcases more muscle definition, creating a stronger and leaner appearance.5. Decreases your risk of fallsStrength training lowers your risk of falls, as youre better able to support your body (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source). In fact, one review including 23,407 adults over the age of 60 showed a 34% reduction in falls among those who participated in a well-rounded exercise program that included balance exercises and resistance and functional training (18Trusted Source).Fortunately, many forms of strength training have been shown to be effective, such as tai chi, weight training, and resistance band and bodyweight exercises (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).6. Lowers your risk of injury Including strength training in your exercise routine may reduce your risk of injury.Strength training helps improve the strength, range of motion, and mobility of your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. This can reinforce strength around major joints like your knees, hips, and ankles to provide additional protection against injury (1Trusted Source).Whats more, strength training can help correct muscular imbalances. For example, having a stronger core, hamstrings, and glutes takes the load off of your lower back during lifting, decreasing your risk of lower-back injuries (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).Finally, adult and teenage athletes that engage in strength training have a lower likelihood of injury (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).In fact, one review including 7,738 athletes found strength-training programs reduced the risk of injury by 33%. It was found to lower the risk of injury in a dose-dependent manner, meaning for every 10% increase in strength-training volume, there was a 4% reduced risk of injury (30Trusted Source).7. Improves heart health Multiple studies have shown that regular strength-training exercise can decrease blood pressure, lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, and improve blood circulation by strengthening the heart and blood vessels (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).Strength training also can help you maintain a healthy body weight and manage your blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels are a major risk factor for heart disease (31Trusted Source).8. Helps manage your blood sugar levels Strength training may lower your risk of developing diabetes and can help those with the condition manage it better.Skeletal muscle helps increase insulin sensitivity. It also reduces blood sugar levels by removing glucose from the blood and sending it to muscle cells. As a result, greater muscle mass can help improve blood sugar management (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).Strength training may also reduce your risk of developing diabetes. One study following 35,754 women for an average of 10 years showed a 30% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes among those who engaged in strength training compared with those who did not (39Trusted Source).9. Promotes greater mobility and flexibility Contrary to popular belief, strength training can make you more flexible.Strength training increases joint range of motion (ROM), allowing for greater mobility and flexibility. Plus, those with weaker muscles tend to have lower ROM and flexibility (40Trusted Source).In fact, a recent review comparing stretching with strength training found they were equally effective at increasing ROM (41Trusted Source).For best results, ensure youre completing the full ROM of an exercise — in other words, utilize your full movement potential around a joint. For example, lower yourself into a squat as far as youre able to go without compromising your form (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).10. Boosts your self-esteemStrength training can add a major boost to your self-confidence.It helps you overcome challenges, work toward a goal, and appreciate your bodys strength. In particular, it can increase your self-efficacy — the belief that youre able to succeed at or perform a task — which can greatly improve your confidence (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).In fact, one review of 7 studies in youth ages 10–16 years observed a significant association between strength training and high self-esteem, physical strength, and physical self-worth (47Trusted Source).Additionally, a systematic review that studied 754 adults showed a significant link between strength training and positive body image, including body satisfaction, appearance, and social physique anxiety (the perception of judgment from others) (48Trusted Source).11. Makes your bones stronger Strength training is crucial for bone development.Weight-bearing exercises put temporary stress on your bones, sending a message to bone-building cells to take action and rebuild bones stronger. Having strong bones reduces your risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and falls, especially as you age (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source).Fortunately, you can reap the bone-strengthening benefits of strength training at any age.12. Boosts your mood Regular weight training may boost your mood and improve your mental health.Multiple studies have shown that strength training may reduce anxiety and boost your mood (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).Strength training confers multiple benefits to mood regulation, such as increased self-esteem and self-efficacy. Whats more, exercise promotes the release of mood-boosting endorphins, which can play a role in a positive mood (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source).13. Improves brain health Those who engage in strength training may have better brain health and protection against age-related cognitive decline.Multiple studies in older adults have pointed to significant improvements in cognitive function (e.g., processing speed, memory, and executive function) after participating in strength training, compared with those who did not participate in it (58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source).Its thought that resistance training has many neuroprotective effects, such as improved blood flow, reduced inflammation, and an increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is linked to memory and learning (62Trusted Source, 63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source).14 Promotes a better quality of life Strength training may increase your quality of life, especially as you age.Numerous studies have linked strength training to increased health-related quality of life, defined as a persons perceived physical and mental well-being (65Trusted Source, 66Trusted Source).In fact, one review of 16 studies including adults ages 50 years and older showed a significant correlation between resistance training and better mental health, physical functioning, pain management, general health, and vitality ",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

The belts can look like a wider version of a traditional belt—leather with a buckle closure—or come with a wide Velcro closure instead. But do they have a purpose—besides making you look like a hard-core Olympic lifter? And, maybe more importantly, should you be wearing one too?Lifting belts do serve a purpose. But theyre best used only in certain circumstances: when youre lifting heavy weight, and your goal is to lift even heavier weight.Below, we dig into everything you need to know about lifting belts, including what they are, how they work, and when you may want to consider strapping one on.Basically, a weight belt—which wraps and fastens around your abdomen just like a traditional belt—helps you lift safely by providing core-bracing support that protects your spine. Your core muscles help protect your spine while strength training, and a weight lifting belt helps provide extra support to them. Your core muscles fire during compound exercises like the deadlift, squat, or overhead press to help support your spine and keep you from falling forward or backward (bending or flexing) under heavy loads. Remember, your core actually includes your diaphragm on the front of your body, obliques on your sides, and muscles (called the spinal erectors) on your back, as well as your transverse abdominis—your innermost, deep core muscles, which are often referred to as your bodys internal weight lifting belt. All of these muscles engage to help support your spine and complete a movement.Engaging your core, or core bracing, involves breath too. When powerlifters lift heavy loads, they take a breath into their abdomen, engage their core muscles, and hold the breath throughout the rep, exhaling at the top of the move. This creates intra-abdominal pressure so their entire trunk stays stiff when hefting heavy weight, exercise physiologist Tom Holland, MS, CSCS, author of The Micro-Workout Plan, tells SELF. (This technique is called the Valsalva maneuver, and theres been much internet and scientific debate over its safety. In short, its a breathing method thats not intended for beginners and should not be practiced without working alongside a pro first. Whats more, if you have high blood pressure, other heart conditions, or are pregnant, you shouldnt use this technique. Thats because it increases intra-abdominal pressure within the cavity where your lungs and heart are, Tessia DeMattos, DPT, CSCS, certified strength and conditioning specialist and powerlifting coach, tells SELF. Instead, you should inhale and exhale as you normally would So, where does a weight belt come in with all of this? In theory, these belts simply give you extra support, by providing more compression force to your core. This force helps increase the pressure you have within your core and create more stiffness, says DeMattos. The added stiffness means your spine remains better supported, and, theoretically, you may be able to lift more powerfully as a result.While the mechanism above is sound, the actual research on weight lifting belts—especially in a strength training setting—is a little more hazy.“The research into the efficacy of weight belts is mixed and surprisingly limited,” says Holland. We need more (current!) research on belts for performance and for injury prevention, he says, as well as more research on belts for people in gym settings rather than occupational environments. (Lots of the existing research on belts focuses on people who lift heavy weights for work, like delivery employees or stock unloaders But here are a few examples of what the science says so far. A large JAMA study in 2000 looked at nearly 14,000 retail employees who regularly loaded and unloaded heavy boxes as part of their jobs and wore lifting belts. The study found belts were not associated with any reduction in risk of back injuries or low back pain. In other words, wearing the back belts made no difference when it came to protecting against injury. Scientists supported that viewpoint six years later in a review of 22 studies in the Strength and Conditioning Journal, which looked at weight belts in both occupational and industrial settings, as well as those in workout environments. The scientists concluded there was “a general lack of evidence” for any benefits for weight belts on the job.But comparing weight belts used in the gym to those in work settings isnt exactly apples to apples, the authors of the same review write, since the weight is typically lower and more endurance based in a job setting. When researchers looked at weight belts used in workouts, the conclusions were a little different: “Theres no strong evidence against the use of lifting belts,” the authors of the review wrote. Of the eight studies they analyzed that focused on sport settings, five suggested some benefit—mainly for reducing spinal compression, stabilizing the spine, and increasing velocity of the exercise—two found mixed results, and one found no positive outcomes. More recently, a small 2022 study on recreational weight lifters found that using belts, in addition to wrist straps (which support your grip when lifting heavy), helped the lifters to complete deadlifts faster and with better biomechanics than when they werent wearing either. This suggests that the lifting belts and straps provided a greater sense of support, which improved lifting performance.

The actor has promised that this Data version of the character will be angrier than ever, and his intense prep for the movie seems to reflect this: Jackman is hitting two workouts and eating 8,000 calories per day.In a recent video on the Buff Dudes channel, bodybuilder and YouTuber Hudson White spends the day eating and working out like Jackman, and soon finds that the Wolverine routine is not for the faint of heart.For one thing, it costs $180 to buy and prepare just one day's worth of food in Jackman's diet. White usually only consumes around 2,500 calories per day, and so eating 8,000 calories across six meals is an insane challenge in itself. There's only been a few times in my life that I've actually surpassed 5,000 calories, and it's just been a chore, he says. How am I going to put all of this in my body in a 12-hour period?For the first workout of the day, White focuses on lower body, performing the trap bar deadlift, cyclist squats (a staple of old-school bodybuilding), forward/reverse lunges, jumping split squats, and seated calf raises, spending nearly two hours in the gym.Once he has refueled, the second workout of the day is a shorter one, taking just 45 minutes and consisting of pullups, bench press, double clap pushups, single-arm banded flys, dumbbell shoulder press, weighted cross bench dips, dumbbell bicep curls, and decline mobility ball crunches.After following Jackman's routine for just one day, White finds that the usual pleasure he takes from exercising and enjoying food is starting to wane, due to the strictly regimented, high-volume nature of what is required to physically transform for a superhero role.Sadly, doing it this way,when you're having two workouts a day, when you're trying to put 8,000 calories in your body, it's a chore, it's a full-time job really, and I don't like it to be completely honest, I'm not a fan of this, and if I had to do this for a long period of time, I would lose the joy of lifting and eating. The way these actors are doing it, they're yo-yoing for the role and what it requires of them, but for me, I could not do this.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

For good reason, too: The compound lift fires up the hamstrings and glutes, while engaging other muscles through your quads, back, and abs. For most guys, deadlift day begins and ends with the Olympic (or straight) barbell. This unforgiving implement is generally how most strength sports (like powerlifting and strongman) engage with the deadlift, and it is a useful tool to build strength and size—but it might not be the most functional way to train the movement. That distinction goes to another piece of gear: the trap bar.The trap bar shifts your grip from the front of your body to the sides, which is a much more natural way to lift a heavy load off the floor. When youre hinging over to pick up a heavy load of groceries (we see you and your six bags in each arm), youre probably not ending up with the bags in front of your thighs—but thats the way that you lift when you do the barbell deadlift. Youd struggle to walk those bags into the house if you hold them in that same position. Were used to carrying loads on our sides, so why not train our deadlifts the same way?This is where the trap bar has an advantage over the traditional barbell. The bar is fixed in a hexagonal shape, with neutral grip handles in the center. The lifter is able to grasp the load at a natural angle, aiding a more comfortable pull. This reinforces natural movement by situating the load more centrally, all while packing on heavy weights like the straight bar.Still, doing the trap bar deadlift isnt as simple as just pulling the weight off the floor. Like other variations, the trap bar deadlift requires the proper mechanics, says Mens Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel C.S.C.S., as he and fitness editor Brett Williams, N.A.S.M., demonstrate the essentials that can keep your heavyweight lifts safe and effective.Benefits of the Trap Bar DeadliftYou'll have a more natural motion when you lift. “It's going to be a lot easier and a lot more natural for you to pick up in the trap bar",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

with waiters dressed up as doctors and waitresses dressed as nurses",DataDetailDescription:"A US-based restaurant, called Heart Attack Grill, recently came under scanner after it reportedly gave free food to overweight diners. Several viral videos on TikTok and other social media platforms show potential customers lining up outside the controversial eatery in Las Vegas to see whether they qualify for a free meal on a giant weighing scale. As per the viral claims, anybody with a weight of 158 kg or above was eligible for this offer.Soon after the videos went viral, social media became abuzz with people all over the world criticising the restaurant for its dangerous offer, and other harmful servicesFounded in 2005, this restaurant is famous for its high-calorie and unhealthy food options on the menu. With a controversial hospital theme, it refers to its customers as patients with waiters dressed up as doctors and waitresses dressed as nurses. If this wasn’t enough, customers are supposed to change into their hospital gowns after placing their orders.Some of their dishes include the Single Bypass Burger, the Octuple Bypass Burger, Flatliner Fries, and Butterfat Milkshakes. Their food items are available in “Single,” “Double,” “Triple,” “Quadruple,” “Quintuple,” “Sextuple,” “Septuple,” and even “Octuple Bypass” orders. Basically, if such food items are eaten frequently, they can increase the chances of one suffering from a heart attack. While patients who are unable to finish their meals are subjected to brutal spankings, finishing a Triple or Quadruple Bypass Burger will earn the diners a chance to be placed in a wheelchair and wheeled out to their vehicle by their “personal nurse”.Several incidents of death and ill health have been reported in relation to the consumption of the food served by this restaurant. Despite repeated criticism and complaints, Heart Attack Grill thrives on controversy as a marketing strategy.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

The association has been promoting adding olive oil to cocktails.",DataDetailDescription:"Putting olive oil in coffee is hardly a tradition in Italy, but that didn’t stop Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz from launching a series of beverages that do just that in Milan, the city that inspired his coffee house empire.The coffee-olive oil concoction — echoing a keto-inspired trend of adding butter to coffee, only with a sugary twist — has provoked both amusement and curiosity among Italians.Gambero Rosso, an Italian food and wine magazine, called the mixing of olive oil with coffee “a curious combination” but said it was reserving judgment, having not yet sampled the drinksIt did praise featuring the staple of Italian kitchens as a main ingredient, not just a condiment. The magazine also noted the health benefits of consuming extra virgin olive oil, which some Italians do habitually straight from the bottle.“Did we need coffee with extra virgin olive oil and syrups? Maybe yes, maybe no,” wrote the magazine’s Michela Becchi. But the chance to promote Italian excellence is a valuable one, she added.Italy’s olive oil producers’ association, ASSITOL, welcomed “the daring innovation,” saying the line of drinks could ”relaunch the image of olive oil, especially among young people.” The association has been promoting adding olive oil to cocktails.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

While most people rely on packets of instant noodles, others try making them from scratch at home. As such, have you ever tried making your noodles using potatoes? As bizarre as they sound, potato noodles are a staple in many East Asian cuisines, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Potato noodles are believed to have originated in China, where they are called “fun see” or “fen si.” They were originally made from mung bean starch, but over time, the recipe was modified to use potato starch instead.Also known as ‘potato starch noodles’ or ‘glass noodles’, they are translucent, have a slightly chewy texture when cooked, and are often used in soups, stir-fries, and salads. Additionally, potato noodles are also gluten-free, making them a popular alternative for people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Currently going viral on social media, these noodles are easy-to-make and a tasty addition to your menu.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

In 1983, Nasir Amlani, the patriarch, took over Berry’s, a restaurant at Veer Nariman Road, Churchgate. Boasting of a live orchestra and offering Indian, Chinese and Continental food, it became the space where their family bonded and, perhaps, it is where the idea of being a restaurateur took root for the Amlani siblings. The same address saw Riyaaz Amlani starting Mocha in 2002, which led to the birth of his empire Impresario Handmade Restaurants. And, now his younger brother Rizwan, a graduate of the French Culinary Institute, New York, and CEO of Dope Coffee Roasters, has parked Mezcalita, an 83-seater Mexican cantina and tequila bar, at the same address.Talking about Berry’s, Riyaaz, 48, says, “Our father wasn’t a restauranteur, he was more like an entrepreneur. He would go there every day; it was the only outing we had. We would go there and have butter chicken and triple Schezwan rice. Sometimes we would even pack it and take it to school.” For Rizwan, it is where he would bond with the family. “I remember being 10 years old or so and someone — either dad or Riyaaz — putting a tie on me. I would tuck my shirt in and go from one table to another taking orders. My favourite part was the pantry, it was where the sandwiches were and I remember thinking that this is what I would like to be.”While Rizwan realised his passion early on, Riyaaz tried selling shoes before setting up bowling alleys and go-karting tracks. “It is then that the realisation hit — not everyone bowled or went go-karting, some just met for a cup of coffee and a chutney sandwich,” says Riyaaz. At the time, there was a dearth of such spaces in Mumbai. Thus Mocha was born in 2002. “It was all about coffee and conversations. We offered good coffee, desserts sourced from home chefs and rudimentary sandwiches. We even introduced conversation cookies which had provocative topics to propel conversations,” says Riyaaz.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

While some foods are commonly prepared for pre-and post-fast meals, many also experiment with their culinary skills and try new recipes to indulge with their family and friends. So if, over the weekend, you wish to try something new, how about preparing Nargisi kofta — a preparation made with ground meat mixture wrapped around a hard-boiled egg and cooked in a rich gravy — you’ve come to the right place. However, this recipe ditches the gravy altogether.The name nargisi kofta comes from the dish’s resemblance to a winter flower named Narcissus (Nargis), which is found in India. The flower has a yellow center (the colour of cooked egg yolk), surrounded by white petals resembling the cooked egg white. Hence, when the Nargisi kofta is cut in half, it can remind you of the beautiful flower.1. Start off by processing the chillies, coriander and onions together to crush them into pieces but don’t turn into a paste.2. Add 2 eggs to the mince followed by fresh coriander, coriander seeds, and garlic and ginger paste. Mix well.3. At this stage, do a taste test and adjust if you wish. This amount of chilli and masala is enough to make spicy kebabs but if you want it less spicy, then just add 1 chilli and 1.5 masala packet instead.4. Boil the eggs in the meantime.5. Once mixed, flatten the kebabs and put the egg in it and roll it up.6. You can either bake, fry it or cook into a curry.7.

From jerk seasoning with its sweet, heady notes of allspice to ground blends like garam masala and ras el hanout that are warming with cinnamon and cloves, spice blends are responsible for creating the signature flavors of some of our favorite recipes, and play an integral role in culinary traditions around the world.Here, we’re sharing seven iconic spice blends, each with its own unique flavor profile and culinary significance, along with some of our favorite ways to use them — and these spice blends can all be easily made at home. For the freshest, most potent spice blend, start with whole spices and grind them up in a spice grinder. However if you don’t have the time or equipment to do so, you can purchase ground spices in bulk (many Latin, Mexican, Indian, Asian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern grocery stores sell ground spices in large quantities at an affordable price) and mix them yourself. Alternatively, there are plenty of pre-mixed spice blends available at grocery stores or from specialty retailers like or Burlap & Barrel.A popular seasoning in the Middle East, Za’atar is a spice blend that is typically made with dried thyme, oregano, sumac, sesame seeds, caraway, marjoram, and dill. The combination of spices has an earthy, tangy, and nutty flavor that complements a variety of dishes. It’s an essential topping on Lachuch, a soft and spongy Yemenite flatbread. Additionally, it’s versatile enough to use on vegetables like these Roasted Carrots with Preserved Lemons and Dates, or with earthy meats like lamb as featured in this Lamb Sliders with Yogurt-Tahini Sauce. Za’atar can also be a star at breakfast, too. Win your next brunch with this Za'atar Baked Eggs recipe. Ras el hanout is a spice blend that originated in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. The name translates to  indicating that it is a spice blend that often varies from market to market and region to region. While there’s no set recipe, you’ll typically find some mixture of  black pepper, white pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, anise cloves, ginger, cumin, coriander, cayenne, turmeric, and sumac. It has a well-rounded flavor profile with warm and slightly sweet notes from the nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. This blend is traditionally used in tajines but is also particularly well-suited for rich meats like pork and duck in recipes like Pork Chops with Sherry Pan Sauce with Ras Al Hanout and these Spiced Duck Breasts with Mandarin Oranges and Dates. Garam masala is a warm aromatic spice blend that originates from northern India. Garam means while masala means blend, but the spice itself is not necessarily spicy-hot.Jerk seasoning has a long history in Jamaican cuisine and is believed to have originated with the Maroons, a group of enslaved Africans who escaped from the plantations and settled in the hills of Jamaica. Today, it is a beloved spice blend around the world, featuring prominently in many Caribbean and Jamaican dishes.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

I work at Food & Wine, I care about things like garnishing my scrambled eggs in a cute way, and I deeply appreciate a good cocktail (or mocktail). Still, when it comes to my at-home coffee situation, the standards are  floor-level. My roommate and I have been brewing our daily coffee in an ancient Mr. Coffee machine for the past four years — the coffee pot actually came with the first apartment we got together, so its age is undetermined, and someone clearly didn’t care enough to take it when they moved out. It also doesn’t help that we’re reluctant to buy anything but the cheapest coffee beans available at the grocery store. Even if you happen to have a coffee scale and Chemex at home, odds are at some point you’ll end up in an office, great aunt’s house, hotel room, or somewhere else with mediocre  coffee — and that’s when you’ll be grateful for these tips on how to make it taste better.Okay, don’t literally add the cinnamon to the pot — you want to add your spices to the coffee grounds before you brew. This is an easy way to make your coffee more aromatic, flavorful, and cozy-feeling; it’s one of my favorite tricks in the wintertime. Any warm baking spices will work, such as nutmeg, star anise, cloves, or cardamom (the latter is especially good), but I’m more likely to have ground cinnamon on hand than anything else. Simply add a pinch or two of the ground spice to the grinds in your coffee filter, give it a stir to evenly distribute things, and brew as normal.Want to feel like you just went through the drive-thru at Starbucks, without the $6 hole in your pocket ?Add some foamy milk to your cup of joe, and you’ll instantly feel a little fancier. Milk will hold bubbles (as in, it’ll become foamy) when it’s warm –– so, to create a little layer of froth for your coffee, just pour a little milk into a sealable container, like a jar or tupperware. This will work slightly better with a dairy milk, but non-dairy alternatives will hold some bubbles too. Microwave it until thoroughly warm, but not scalding hot. Then add the appropriate lid, and shake the container vigorously for about thirty seconds. The result should be some frothy milk that will make it feel like you’re drinking a cappuccino.The obvious answer to making bad coffee taste better is to simply add more sugar, and there’s no way better to do that than by stirring a packet of hot chocolate mix into your mug. This is basically a cheat code for making a mocha at home, and the combination of sugar and milk powder is really great at masking overly bitter coffee. Make sure you use a cocoa mix that’s meant to be dissolved in water, like Swiss Miss. One of the biggest benefits of this hack is that it doesn’t require intervention before the coffee is brewed — so if your mother-in-law already started the pot, you can still save your own cup.According to the rules of science — which I know to be true, although I don’t really know why — either salt or sugar can help offset and cut bitter flavors. (A fun way to test this is by trying a leaf of radicchio without seasoning, then with salt, with honey, and with both salt and honey. But I digress.) Sprinkle a small amount of salt — think just half of a pinch — into your coffee grounds before brewing to reduce excess sharpness and acidity.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Think about the coffee aisle in the supermarket, where large industrial grinders take whole beans and divvy them into small pieces. The practice of coffee grinding is so ubiquitous that it's even a bonus task on the television show Supermarket Sweep — both the original show and the newly rebooted version. Contestants can patiently grind a bag of coffee for extra cash. Grinding coffee is an essential step in the brewing process, and with so many affordable options, it's a step you should consider taking out of the supermarket and into your home. Like many things at the supermarket, coffee is a food item that begins to get stale sooner if you grind it ahead of time. Grinding at home will allow you to enjoy the freshest, tastiest version of your favorite brew. Here's everything you need to know about how to grind for any situation.Grinding makes coffee particles small enough so that when you pour water, it can extract flavor. If you simply throw whole beans into your coffee brewer, you'll end up with slightly coffee-flavored water, because the water can't penetrate the beans and find all the good-tasting stuff we're looking for. Grind size ultimately impacts how water flows through the coffee bed, the corresponding extraction rate, and thus the final taste of the coffee you've brewed, says Sierra Yeo, the 2022 UK Brewers Cup Champion. Simply put, grinding coffee changes the available surface area for water to interact with coffee. The more surface area, the more water can mingle with, and pull flavor from, beans. Blade grinders: Blade grinders have a propellor-like blade, usually powered by a motor, that chops coffee into smaller pieces. However, blade grinders are notorious for chopping coffee unevenly, creating particles of all sizes. If you grind coffee with a blade grinder, you sort of never know what you're going to get: you might have particles that are dust-like in size, and others that look like giant boulders (sometimes a bean or two might even escape the blade, and not be chopped at all). Burr grinders: Burrs are usually a set of plates that allow coffee beans to pass through, ensuring that they don't get chopped up again and making the resulting ground coffee much more even in size. Burrs can be made from stainless steel or porcelain, and you control the grind size by moving the burrs closer to, or further from, one another. Burr grinders can be automatic (you press a button, and it grinds) or manual (usually involving a crank one must turn). Blade grinder: If you prefer a blade grinder for its more compact sizing and cheaper price tag, we recommend the KRUPS Silent Vortex Electric Grinder. Simple and straightforward, this powerful grinder features durable stainless steel blades that operate on only one setting. Its grinding chamber holds 3 ounces of whole beans, suitable for 12 cups of coffee. Before you begin, you should decide what brewer you will use and decide on a grind setting for that machine. You might have read somewhere that for a French press, for example, you're supposed to grind coarsely, and while that might work for you, its important to know that theres no one right way to grind. There can be recommendations from manufacturers or experts in the field, but ultimately you can experiment to find out what flavor profile you prefer from your coffees and adjust your grind size to achieve that, says Yeo.

He was 61.The cause was pneumonia complicated by colorectal cancer that had metastasized to his lungs and brain, said Terry Erickson, his partner of 41 years. Mr. Iyer lived in Minneapolis and was visiting San Francisco at his death.Mr. Erickson was one of the first people Mr. Iyer met when he arrived in Minnesota from Mumbai at 21 to attend a small but well-regarded hospitality management program. He had picked it because it was the least expensive one he could find in America.“When I first got to this country, I was almost embarrassed about where I was from and the food we ate,” he said in an interview with The New York Times in February. After a while, he said, he realized that his culture was the “tool” he could use to overcome feelings of inferiority.Mr. Iyer parlayed a rascally charm and a palate imprinted by the vegetarian South Indian food of his childhood into a prolific career, one built in part on the cookbooks of Madhur Jaffrey and Julie Sahni, the Indian cooking heavyweights who began their culinary careers in the 1970s. He referred to them as “the grandes dames of Indian cooking.”His contributions were a bridge to a new breed of American cooks and cookbook authors from the Indian diaspora, like Nik Sharma and Asha Gomez, who broke with classic preparations and found success playing with ingredients — swapping feta for the Indian cheese paneer, for example, or replacing the crust of a pizza with naan.Mr. Iyer consulted for restaurants around the country, taught countless workshops, led tours to India, created a line of frozen Indian meals for Target and instructed thousands of professional cooks at universities, museums and companies, including Google.But his favorite thing was helping individual cooks confidently tackle dishes like curries and biryanis, often using basic ingredients that are common in supermarkets.Mr. Iyer published “Betty Crocker’s Indian Home Cooking,” the first of his seven books, in 2001. The Betty Crocker company hadn’t been in the market for an Indian cookbook, but Mr. Iyer kept pressing an editor he knew at General Mills, Betty Crocker’s corporate parent, with headquarters in Minneapolis.Betty Crocker eventually let him cook a multicourse Indian lunch for a collection of executives and book publishers. It was a spectacular success.

The cherry blossoms were pinking the side streets on Staten Island the other morning as I drove the family down from Joe and Pat’s pizzeria to the beach at Great Kills, for a walk out to Crooke’s Point.It was one of those days that feel like a vacation, a small adventure, a taste of the world beyond. We walked on the hard sand above the tide line, and I felt as I sometimes do walking through the Garden District in New Orleans when the bougainvillea scents the air. Everything was possibility.So maybe a vegan dinner, then? Millie Peartree has a terrific new recipe for blackened cauliflower, spiced hard and cooked on a preheated sheet pan, that would pair beautifully with Alexa Weibel’s super-creamy vegan mac and cheese (above). I think you could make that tonight.Ali Slagle has a new recipe for salmon with asparagus and nori rice that’s also shaping up as a weeknight winner, since you can cook the asparagus and ginger-coated salmon in the same pan. Cooking the rice with dried seasoned seaweed gives it a fine oceanic flavor, excellent alongside the fish. Going forward, I think we’ll be cooking a lot of nori rice.I love Melissa Clark’s recipe for pepperoni pasta with lemon and garlic, though I hold back on some of the crisped-up pepperoni to add at the end, for texture. One subscriber adds a dollop of mascarpone. I’d go with ricotta myself.Chag Pesach sameach! Passover begins today, though you need not be observant to enjoy Joan Nathan’s chicken with artichokes and lemon, a tagine that goes well with couscous — or not, depending on your Passover traditions.More Ali Slagle, this time with a beautiful roasted fish with lemon, sesame and herb bread crumbs. Which fish? Ali calls for freshwater trout. I might go with flounder instead.And then you can end the week with Eric Kim’s new recipe for sticky ginger-and-honey-baked chicken. Shellac the drumsticks with a simple marinade of ground ginger, soy and honey, then bake them over root vegetables for a delicious one-pan meal. It is the best kind of comfort food.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

Accompanied by warm buttery pan-toasted rolls, this visually delightful dish is sure to fill your tummy as well as your heart! ",DataDetailDescription:"Pav Bhaji is a combo dish of Pav(meaning bread), and bhaji(meaning curried mashed vegetables). Mumbai Paav Bhaji, the King of Indian Fast Food, is an immensely gratifying meal, that will transport you to gastronomical bliss. Pav Bhaji is not only a sure-shot party pleaser but also a wholesome satisfying weeknight dinner.  Mumbai Pav Bhaji is quite popular all over India as one of the most loved and flavorful street food. The best part I like about making Mumbai Pav Bhaji, is that you don’t have to be super precise in your initial prep and chopping. First, cook the roughly chopped vegetables together in the ginger-garlic, onion-tomato base. Next, lightly mash the cooked veggies, bringing forth the distinctly spicy-tangy flavors. The final dish is incredibly tasty and presentable, you will be surprised at how little effort went into making this goodness!A great combination of nutritious mixed vegetables in a lip-smacking tomato base, Paav Bhaji is one of the best ways to get your kids to eat their veggies.The Curry (Bhaji) is served with soft buns or dinner rolls AKA pav that are not sweet. In the US, some cities have Indian Bakeries such as Hot Breads that make the traditional Indian Pav. If you have one near you, do grab their fresh soft buns, For the rest of us who may not have easy access to teh traditional Pav, buy buns or soft rolls from grocery stores that have 2 grams of sugar or less. I prefer buying soft potato buns, burgers buns, or Whole foods dinner rolls.The best way to serve piping hot Pav Bhaji is with warm buttery rolls or buns. Spoon the bhaji onto plates, sprinkle with red onion, and serve with the toasted buns and lime or lemon wedges on the side. You can also place the bhaji directly on the buns and serve it like sloppy joes. I often like to pair pav bhaji with either Veg Pulao or Sweet Coconut Rice for a full meal that works great for entertaining, game nights, or movie nights.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},

But one thing is consistent: the process to make it is long and complex. My family's treasured recipe transforms Chicken Biryani into a quick, accessible dish. There are many variations of this recipe that originate in several states of India. My favorite, of course, is the one made by my mom that I grew up eating. Warm, deep spiced Chicken Biryani, with freshly ground spices, caramelized onions, marinated tender chicken cooked over long grain basmati rice.Biryani is a rice dish with vegetables, chicken, or fish marinated in yogurt and warm spices such as turmeric, red chili powder, and garam masala. It is traditionally slow-cooked by layering the marinated meat or vegetables over the rice and is topped with caramelized onions, aromatic saffron, and fresh cilantro or mint.It is said that Biryani is originally a Persian dish that eventually made its way to South Asia. Since then there have been many regional variations of this majestic dish based on the cooking methods.Dum Biryani - Layers of meat and partially cooked rice are added to a heavy-bottomed pot which is sealed tightly with raw dough so the flavors and steam do not escape. It is then slow-cooked for hours. This is also how my mom made her Biryani on the stovetop.Kacchi Biryani - Raw meat is cooked by layering over rice and then slow-cooked.Pukka Biryani - Partially cooked meat and rice are layered and cooked.As biryani became popular in South Asia, several regional variations of this dish came along. Starting with the Kacchi style Hyderabadi Dum Biryani, the Malabar Pukka Biryani from coastal India, the Calcutta Biryani with potatoes from eastern India, spicy Chettinad Biryani from the southern states, and the flavorful, tangy Sindhi Biryani from Sindh, Pakistan. Many more variations and recipes but one thing that is common is that they are all incredibly tasty!Given how much we enjoy Chicken Biryani, I had to try mom's recipe in the Instant Pot. After a few attempts, I was able to simplify it so much that it can be easily prepared for a weeknight meal using the Instant Pot.

As such, to stay active and energetic throughout the day while fasting, it is important to eat healthy and nutritious food during sehri (pre-dawn meal) and iftar (meal eaten at dusk while breaking fast). So, if you have been scouting for recipes to break or begin your fast with, celebrity fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala has an easy, delicious, and nutritious chia pudding recipe that you can easily whip up for sehri.“Ramadan Kareem everyone! We are constantly struggling with what to eat for sehri. So today, I’m going to share with you my favourite go-to — chia pudding. It’s packed with essential nutrients to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day,” Karichawala wrote in an Instagram post, as she shared the nutritious recipe.Add ½ cup milk of choice and ½ cup mangoes to a blender. Blend until smooth Add blueberry mix along with 2 tbsp chia seeds, 2 tsp maple syrup , and ½ tsp vanilla extract to a mason jar Mix together and let sit in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours, but preferably overnight.Stir together, then add toppings like plain Greek yoghurt and fresh mango slices Enjoy!Chia pudding can be a great option for suhoor, as it is high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Speaking with indianexpress.com, Sameena Ansari – Senior Dietitian and Nutritionist, CARE Hospitals, Hi-Tec City, Hyderabad, said: “The fiber and protein in chia seeds can help to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day, which can be especially helpful during Ramadan, when meals are limited. Chia seeds are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and support overall health”.*Chia seeds absorb a lot of liquid, so it is important to use the right ratio of chia seeds to liquid to avoid a clumpy or dry texture.*Chia seeds can be a choking hazard if not properly soaked and hydrated, so consume them carefully.While chia pudding can be a healthy addition to your suhoor meal, it is important to balance it with other nutritious foods to ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs.",avatar:"https://imgs.search.brave.com/fheKHA24ms7oYoRYaBxDV2piKTh8oQQc-2qtESQYCI0/rs:fit:800:930:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wNy5o/aWNsaXBhcnQuY29t/L3ByZXZpZXcvNy82/MTgvNTA1L2F2YXRh/ci1pY29uLWZhc2hp/b24tbWVuLXZlY3Rv/ci1hdmF0YXIuanBn",name:"Sayatya Das",date:"Sep 23, 2023"},
